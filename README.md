# Liar's Dice

Liar's dice with points rather than losing dice, created for AirConsole.

## How to play

Each player gets five dice, which are rolled at the beginning of each round. You are only allowed to see your dice. (Protip: Tap your dice to hide them from prying eyes)

Players take it in turns to bid, guessing how many of a certain type of dice there are among all the players. The current player is indicated with ➤. If a player thinks that the last person's bid was wrong, they can challenge it.

### Bidding

The bid always has to be raised, either the value of the dice (1 is lowest, 6 is highest) or the quantity of dice, or both.

For example, if the first player bid 4 2's - they think that there are four dice showing ⚁ (and ⚀ if ones are wild),

The next player could bid:
* 4 3's (raising the value of the dice)
* 5 2's (raising the quantity)
* 5 4's (both)

The game will automatically make sure your bid is valid before you can place it.


### Challenging

When someone challenges the last bid, all the dice in play are shown on the screen with a total, to see who was right. The person who was correct gets a point.

The player who was wrong will be the starting player in the next round.
