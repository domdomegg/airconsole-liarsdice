            <h2>How to play</h2>
            <p>Each player gets five dice, which are rolled at the beginning of each round. You are only allowed to see your dice. (Protip: Tap your dice to hide them from prying eyes)</p>
            <p>Players take it in turns to bid, guessing how many of a certain type of dice there are among all the players. The current player is indicated with ➤. If a player thinks that the last person’s bid was wrong, they can challenge it.</p>
            <h3>Bidding</h3>
            <p>The bid always has to be raised, either the value of the dice (1 is lowest, 6 is highest) or the quanity of dice, or both.</p>
            <p>For example, if the first player bid 4 2’s - they think that there are four dice showing ⚁ (and ⚀ if ones are wild),</p>
            <p>The next player could bid:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>4 3’s (raising the value of the dice)</li>
                <li>5 2’s (raising the quantity)</li>
                <li>5 4’s (both)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The game will automatically make sure your bid is valid before you can place it.</p>
            <h3>Challenging</h3>
            <p>When someone challenges the last bid, all the dice in play are shown on the screen with a total, to see who was right. The person who was correct gets a point.</p>
            <p>The player who was wrong will be the starting player in the next round.</p>
